Car Counting using Raspberry Pi Zero W

By: Shreenidhi Jayaram, Qinglang Yu

Abstract

An increase in population in city limits often correlates to higher vehicle congestion. Such congestion ultimately leads to the need to monitor traffic in order to be able to better control it. In pursuit of that, weâ€™d need to employ a raspberry pi system coupled with a camera to count the number of vehicles passing through the frame at any given instant in time. Estimating the vehicle traffic per unit time is essential to monitoring air traffic pollution.
